- [ ] Verify Cloudflare access: `wrangler whoami`
- [ ] Check infrastructure: `wrangler d1 list` and `wrangler r2 bucket list`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `cd cloudflare/workers && npm install`

### Critical Systems Validation
- [ ] **Issue #64**: Database Schema Deployment
- [ ] **Issue #66**: Migration Tools Production  
- [ ] **Issue #67**: Security Hardening
- [ ] **Issue #65**: Monitoring & Alerting

### QC Steps

#### 1. Verify Database Schema Status
```bash
# Check database table counts
wrangler d1 execute cutty-dev --command "SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
wrangler d1 execute cutty-staging --command "SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
wrangler d1 execute cutty-prod --command "SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
```

**Expected Results:**
- cutty-dev: ~28 tables
- cutty-staging: ~25 tables  
- cutty-prod: ~16 tables

#### 2. Validate Critical R2 Tables Exist
```bash
# Check for critical R2StorageService tables
wrangler d1 execute cutty-prod --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name IN ('files', 'multipart_uploads', 'file_access_logs', 'api_keys', 'audit_logs');"
```

**Expected Result:** All 5 tables should be listed

#### 3. Test Database Integrity
```bash
# Check foreign key constraints
wrangler d1 execute cutty-prod --command "PRAGMA foreign_key_check;"
```

**Expected Result:** No output (no constraint violations)

#### 4. Verify Performance Indexes
```bash
# Check indexes on files table
wrangler d1 execute cutty-prod --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' AND tbl_name='files';"
```

**Expected Result:** Multiple indexes listed (idx_files_user_id, etc.)

### ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] All environments have appropriate table counts
- [ ] Critical R2 tables exist in production
- [ ] No foreign key constraint violations
- [ ] Performance indexes are properly created
