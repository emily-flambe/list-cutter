# Claude Configuration Directory

This directory contains simplified configuration files for Claude Code to understand the Cutty (List Cutter) project.

## Files

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main configuration file with project overview and key commands
- **project-config.yml** - Project settings, environments, and common commands
- **troubleshooting.yml** - Common issues and fixes
- **subagents.yml** - AI persona system (3 core personas)
- **commands-all.md** - Comprehensive command reference
- **architecture-overview.md** - System architecture and tech stack

## Simplified Structure

We've reduced from 15+ files to 6 core files by:
- Consolidating 8 subagents to 3 personas
- Merging 5 YAML configs to 2
- Flattening 3 subdirectories
- Removing duplicate content
- Direct content instead of @includes

## Usage

Claude Code will automatically read these files to understand:
- Project structure and naming
- Development workflows
- Deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting steps
- Architecture decisions

The simplified structure makes it easier to maintain and update the configuration.
