## Git Worktree Management
- All debugging and feature worktrees should be created in `worktrees/` directory within this project
- Use naming convention: `worktrees/[purpose]`
- Example: `git worktree add worktrees/debug`
- This keeps worktrees organized within the project structure

## Testing Philosophy
**CRITICAL: NEVER overengineer tests**
- Create minimal, focused tests that verify basic functionality only
- Use simple mocks that match actual implementations  
- Set realistic expectations appropriate for test environments
- Avoid complex custom error types and elaborate test scenarios
- Write tests that are easy to maintain and don't become a burden
- Focus on core functionality verification rather than comprehensive edge cases
- **Test philosophy: Simple, practical, maintainable**

### Analytics Engine Testing Rule
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ALWAYS SKIP ANALYTICS ENGINE IN TESTS ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- AnalyticsEngine datasets MUST ALWAYS be commented out in vitest.config.ts
- NEVER attempt to configure or enable analyticsEngineDatasets in test configuration
- Analytics functionality should be skipped/mocked in all test environments
- This is a strict requirement that cannot be overridden under any circumstances
- Any attempt to include AnalyticsEngine in tests will cause configuration errors and test failures

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (Hono.js + TypeScript)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite at edge)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 object storage with global CDN
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Material-UI)
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright with comprehensive coverage
- **Security**: JWT authentication, API keys, comprehensive monitoring
- **Legacy**: Django backend (migration target)

### Key Commands for Daily Development

```bash
# Start development environment
cd cloudflare/workers && npm run dev
cd app/frontend && npm run dev

# Run comprehensive tests
cd cloudflare/workers && npm test

# Build and validate
npm run build && npx wrangler versions upload --dry-run

# Deploy to staging
wrangler deploy --env=staging
```
