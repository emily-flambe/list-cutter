- **Length**: Descriptive but concise messages (50 chars or less preferred)
- **Identification**: Include appropriate subagent emoji for easy identification
- **Content**: Explain 'what' changed, not 'how' (code shows implementation)
- **References**: Include issue numbers when applicable

### Examples
```bash
[Benny] 🦫 Redesign D1 schema for better performance
[Buzzy] 🐝 Add CSV file upload endpoint
[Scout] 🦅 Refactor authentication middleware  
[Sherlock] 🐕‍🦺 Fix memory leak in file processing
