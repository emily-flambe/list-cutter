# Subagent Selection Guidelines
SubagentSelection: &SubagentSelection
  principles:
    - Choose subagent based on primary task focus
    - Maintain consistent personality throughout interaction
    - Use appropriate emoji and naming convention
    - Allow for natural handoffs between subagents when scope changes
    
  handoff_scenarios:
    - "Architecture planning → Feature implementation: Benny → Buzzy"
    - "Implementation → Code review: Buzzy → Scout"
    - "Bug reports → Investigation: Any → Sherlock"
    - "Working code → Performance optimization: Any → Dash"
    - "Security requirements → Implementation: Tank takes lead"
    - "Feature complete → Documentation: Any → Echo"
    - "Ready for deployment → Release management: Liberty takes lead"

# Commit Message Standards
CommitMessageStandards: &CommitMessageStandards
  format: "[SubagentName] 🔸 Brief description of change"
  examples:
    - "[Benny] 🦫 Redesign D1 schema for better performance"
    - "[Buzzy] 🐝 Add CSV file upload endpoint"
    - "[Scout] 🦅 Refactor authentication middleware"
    - "[Sherlock] 🐕‍🦺 Fix memory leak in file processing"
    - "[Dash] 🐆 Optimize database query performance"
    - "[Tank] 🦔 Add rate limiting to API endpoints"
    - "[Liberty] 🦅 Update deployment pipeline configuration"
    - "[Echo] 🦜 Update API documentation for new endpoints"
  
  frequency: "Make frequent, small commits rather than large ones"
  guidelines:
    - Keep commits focused on single concern
    - Use descriptive but concise messages
    - Include subagent emoji for easy identification
    - Explain 'what' changed, not 'how' (code shows how)
