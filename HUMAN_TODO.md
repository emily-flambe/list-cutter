# Phase 5.5: Critical R2 Follow-up Tasks - Human Action Items

## Overview
This document outlines the human actions required before, during, and after the implementation of Phase 5.5 technical plans. Each section corresponds to specific technical implementation plans and includes coordination, decision-making, and verification steps that require human intervention.

## Pre-Implementation Actions (Before Starting Any Work)

### 1. Environment and Access Preparation

#### A. Cloudflare Account Setup
```bash
# Verify Cloudflare account access
wrangler auth login

# Check available resources
wrangler whoami
wrangler d1 list
wrangler r2 bucket list
```

**Human Actions Required:**
- [ ] Verify you have admin access to Cloudflare account
