# Post-Incident Recovery Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures comprehensive follow-up activities after incident resolution, including system validation, documentation, analysis, and improvement implementation. Use this checklist to maintain high service quality and prevent incident recurrence.

## Phase 1: Immediate Post-Incident (0-4 hours)

### System Validation and Monitoring
- [ ] **Extended System Monitoring**
  - [ ] Monitor system for 4 hours post-resolution
  - [ ] Set enhanced alerting sensitivity
  - [ ] Verify no secondary issues arising
  - [ ] Confirm stable performance metrics

```bash
# Enhanced monitoring for 4 hours
echo "Starting 4-hour post-incident monitoring..."
for i in {1..240}; do  # 240 iterations = 4 hours (1 minute intervals)
  echo "$(date): Monitoring cycle $i/240"
  
  # Check overall health
  HEALTH=$(curl -s "https://your-worker.example.com/health/status" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" | jq -r ".data.overall_status")
  
  # Check error rates
  ERROR_RATE=$(curl -s "https://your-worker.example.com/health/metrics?minutes=5" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" | jq -r ".data.error_rate")
  
  # Check queue status
  QUEUE_SIZE=$(curl -s "https://your-worker.example.com/health/queue/status" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" | jq -r ".data.total_queued")
  
  echo "Health: $HEALTH, Error Rate: $ERROR_RATE%, Queue: $QUEUE_SIZE"
  
  # Alert if issues detected
  if [ "$HEALTH" != "HEALTHY" ] || (( $(echo "$ERROR_RATE > 5" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "⚠️  Issue detected during post-incident monitoring!"
    # Trigger alert or escalation
  fi
  
  sleep 60
done
```

- [ ] **Queue Processing Verification**
  - [ ] Confirm all queued operations processed
  - [ ] Verify no failed operations remaining
  - [ ] Check operation success rates
  - [ ] Validate user data integrity

```bash
# Verify queue processing completion
curl -X GET https://your-worker.example.com/health/queue/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"

# Check for any failed operations
curl -X GET "https://your-worker.example.com/health/queue/operations?status=FAILED" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
