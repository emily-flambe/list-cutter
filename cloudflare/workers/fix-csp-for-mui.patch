## Quick CSP Fix for Material-UI

The CSP errors are happening because the security middleware is generating a nonce and replacing 'unsafe-inline' in the style-src directive. Material-UI requires 'unsafe-inline' for its CSS-in-JS to work.

### Temporary Solutions:

1. **Quick Fix - Disable nonce generation for now:**
   Edit your app initialization to disable nonce generation:
   ```typescript
   // In your security headers middleware initialization
   enableNonceGeneration: false
   ```

2. **Better Fix - Allow both nonce and unsafe-inline for styles:**
   Modify the CSP to include both:
   ```
   style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'nonce-{nonce}' https://fonts.googleapis.com
   ```

3. **Production Fix - Use Material-UI's CSP configuration:**
   Material-UI can be configured to work with CSP nonces, but it requires additional setup.

### For now, focus on OAuth debugging

The CSP errors won't prevent OAuth from working. They're just visual styling issues. 

To see the OAuth debug logs:
1. Open browser Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try the OAuth flow
4. Look for messages starting with `[OAuth Debug]`

The debug logs will show:
- State validation results
- Token exchange parameters
- Exact error from Google
- User creation process

Share those logs to identify the OAuth issue!
