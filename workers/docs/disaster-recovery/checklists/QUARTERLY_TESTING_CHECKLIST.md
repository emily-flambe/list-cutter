# Quarterly Disaster Recovery Testing Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures comprehensive quarterly testing of all disaster recovery systems and procedures. Regular testing validates that recovery capabilities meet RTO/RPO objectives and that the team is prepared for real incidents.

## Pre-Testing Preparation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] **Test Environment Preparation**
  - [ ] Test environment isolated from production
  - [ ] Test data prepared and validated
  - [ ] Backup systems operational in test environment
  - [ ] Monitoring systems configured for testing

- [ ] **Team Coordination**
  - [ ] Testing schedule communicated to all teams
  - [ ] Test participants identified and available
  - [ ] Observer roles assigned
  - [ ] Communication channels established

- [ ] **Documentation Review**
  - [ ] Current procedures reviewed and up-to-date
  - [ ] Test scenarios defined and validated
  - [ ] Success criteria established
  - [ ] Emergency procedures available

### Baseline Establishment
- [ ] **System Baseline Capture**
