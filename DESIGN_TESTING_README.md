- Animated cursor (▌) on the home page
- CSS keyframe animation that blinks every second
- Preserved across all themes and layouts

### ✅ Threatening Logout Behavior
- Ominous warning when users attempt to log out
- Special styling: *"THIS GOD WON'T FORGIVE YOU."*
- Red text with Creepster font family

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

When testing new designs, verify:

- [ ] Cutty's messages appear correctly on all pages
- [ ] Blinking cursor works on home page
- [ ] Logout page shows threatening message
- [ ] Navigation works across all screen sizes
- [ ] Theme switching preserves functionality
- [ ] Layout switching maintains user state
- [ ] All-caps styling is preserved
- [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards

## 🚀 Adding New Themes

To add a new theme variant:

1. Edit `src/themes/themeVariants.js`
2. Add your theme object with CSS custom properties
3. The theme will automatically appear in the switcher

Example:
```javascript
newTheme: {
  name: 'My New Theme',
  colors: {
    '--primary-bg': '#your-color',
    '--navbar-bg': '#your-color',
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Adding New Layouts

To create a new layout:

1. Create a new component in `src/components/layouts/`
2. Import and add it to `AppWithLayouts.jsx`
3. Update the `layouts` object in `LayoutSwitcher.jsx`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

- Some Material-UI components may need custom styling for theme compatibility
- Mobile drawer animations may vary between layouts
- Theme switching requires page elements to use CSS custom properties

## 🎉 Have Fun!

This setup lets you experiment freely with different design approaches while ensuring Cutty's personality remains intact. Try different combinations of themes and layouts to find what works best for your users!

Remember: Cutty is watching... 👁️🐙
