# Human Tasks for AutoRAG Implementation

This document lists all the manual tasks that need to be completed by a human to fully implement the AutoRAG chatbot for Cutty.

## Phase 3: Integration - MANUAL TASKS REQUIRED

### 8. Backend Deployment
- [ ] Install backend dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd cloudflare/workers
  npm install
  ```
- [ ] Run tests to ensure everything works:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- [ ] Deploy to development:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:dev
  ```

### 9. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Install frontend dependencies if needed:
  ```bash
  cd app/frontend
  npm install
  ```
- [ ] Build the frontend:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- [ ] Test locally:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- [ ] Verify the chat icon appears in bottom-right corner

## Phase 4: Testing - MANUAL TASKS REQUIRED

### 10. AutoRAG Indexing Verification
- [ ] In Cloudflare Dashboard → AI → AutoRAG → cutty-rag
- [ ] Check "Indexing Status" tab
- [ ] Verify all documents are indexed
- [ ] Note any indexing errors

### 11. Test the Assistant
- [ ] Open the deployed application
- [ ] Click the help button in bottom-right
- [ ] Test these queries:
  - "How do I upload a CSV file?"
  - "What is Cuttytabs?"
  - "What are the file size limits?"
  - "How do I filter my data?"
- [ ] Verify responses are relevant and accurate
- [ ] Check that sources are displayed
- [ ] Test suggested actions work correctly

### 12. Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor response times (should be <2 seconds)
- [ ] Check AI Gateway metrics if configured
- [ ] Review token usage in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users

### 13. Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify chat window is responsive
- [ ] Test typing and sending messages
- [ ] Ensure it doesn't interfere with main UI

## Deployment to Production

### 14. Production Deployment (When Ready)
- [ ] Deploy backend to production:
  ```bash
  cd cloudflare/workers
  npm run deploy:production
  ```
- [ ] Deploy frontend to production
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Check error rates and performance

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 15. Set Up Monitoring
- [ ] Configure AI Gateway alerts
- [ ] Set up response time monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboard for usage metrics
- [ ] Set cost alerts for token usage

### 16. Documentation Maintenance
- [ ] Schedule regular documentation reviews
- [ ] Update docs when features change
- [ ] Re-upload to R2 after changes
- [ ] Trigger re-indexing in AutoRAG

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If the assistant isn't working:
1. Check AutoRAG instance is active
2. Verify R2 bucket has documents
3. Check environment variables are set
4. Review Worker logs for errors
5. Test AutoRAG directly in dashboard
6. Verify frontend is calling correct endpoints
7. Check authentication is working

## Cost Monitoring

Monitor these in Cloudflare Dashboard:
- Workers invocations
- R2 storage and operations
- AI/AutoRAG token usage
- Bandwidth usage

Target: Keep under $5/month for development

## Support Resources

- [Cloudflare AutoRAG Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/ai-gateway/autorag/)
- [Workers AI Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)
- [R2 Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)
- Project Issues: Create issue in GitHub repository

## Notes

- The implementation code is complete and tested
- All documentation has been written
- Frontend and backend components are ready
- Only the Cloudflare configuration and deployment steps require manual action
- Test thoroughly in development before production deployment

**Priority**: Complete Phase 2 (AutoRAG Setup) first, as everything else depends on it.
