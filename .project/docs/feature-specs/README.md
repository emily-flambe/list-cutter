# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed design specifications for Cutty features. Each specification serves as a living reference for development, debugging, and testing.

## Purpose
- Define expected behaviors for each feature
- Establish clear testing criteria
- Document integration points with existing systems
- Provide debugging checklists for common issues
- Outline performance requirements and thresholds

## Available Specifications

### Active Development
- [CUT Dynamic Query Builder](./cut-dynamic-query-builder.md) - Interactive CSV filtering and analysis tool

## Specification Format

Each feature specification should include:
1. **Overview** - Brief description and purpose
2. **Core Components** - Main functional pieces
3. **Expected Behaviors** - How the feature should work
4. **Integration Points** - Connections to existing systems
5. **API Endpoints** - Backend interface definitions
6. **State Management** - Data structures and flow
7. **Error Handling** - User-facing error strategies
8. **Testing Requirements** - Unit, integration, and performance tests
9. **Security Considerations** - Safety and access control
10. **Debugging Checklist** - Common issues and solutions

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Reference specifications during implementation
- Update specs when behavior changes
- Use debugging checklists when troubleshooting
- Validate against testing requirements

### For QA/Testing
- Use expected behaviors as test cases
- Reference error handling for edge cases
- Verify performance against stated thresholds
- Check integration points during regression testing

### For Product/Design
- Understand technical constraints
- Review expected behaviors for UX consistency
- Reference error messages for user communication
- Validate feature completeness against specifications

## Maintenance
- Keep specifications up-to-date with implementation
- Add new features as they enter development
- Archive deprecated features but maintain for reference
- Version specifications when breaking changes occur
