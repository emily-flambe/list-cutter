# Issue #133: Duplicate File Content in Subsequent Generations

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Affected Versions**: All (dev and production)  
**First Reported**: 2025-07-25  

## Summary
When generating multiple synthetic data files in the same chat session, all files after the first contain identical content to the first file, regardless of different parameters.

## Symptoms
- First file: Generates correctly with requested parameters
- Subsequent files: Have unique filenames but identical content to the first file
- Pattern persists across different states, record counts, and other parameters

## Technical Details

### Confirmed Issues
1. **File ID Corruption** (tracked in #132)
   - Last character of UUID increments between generation and download
   - Fuzzy match workaround implemented but may contribute to problem

2. **KV Write Behavior**
   - Writes marked as "non-critical" might be failing silently
   - Verification added but issue persists

3. **Origin Mismatch** (fixed)
   - Agent was calling production API from dev environment
   - Fixed and unit tests added

### Attempted Fixes
1. ✅ Fixed origin detection in agent
2. ✅ Added KV write verification
3. ✅ Fixed fuzzy match to not update fileId variable
4. ✅ Added debug endpoint for KV state inspection
5. ❌ Issue still persists despite all fixes

## Workaround
Currently, users must refresh the page between file generations to ensure unique content.

## Investigation Notes

### Hypothesis Priority
1. **HIGH**: R2/KV caching or key collision
2. **HIGH**: Session state contamination in agent or backend
3. **MEDIUM**: Cloudflare Worker global state issues
4. **LOW**: Frontend caching (unlikely due to unique filenames)

### Debug Information
- KV debug endpoint: `/api/v1/synthetic-data/debug/kv-state`
- Extensive logging added throughout generation and download flow
- File IDs and keys logged at every step

## Related Issues
- #132: File ID Corruption Investigation
- This issue: #133

## Next Steps
1. Add content hashing to verify uniqueness at generation time
2. Add request correlation IDs for full lifecycle tracking
3. Test with isolated sessions
4. Review R2 key generation for potential collisions
5. Check for any worker-level caching

## Code Locations
- Generation: `/cloudflare/workers/src/routes/synthetic-data.ts`
- Agent tools: `/src/tools.ts`
- Session management: `/src/session-state.ts`
