# list-cutter

A simple web app to cut lists, written with a Django backend and a React frontend.

This is deployed to the public internet!

ðŸ‘‰Â https://list-cutter.emilyflam.be ðŸ‘ˆ

The site is hosted on AWS EC2. AWS sure has a lot of _things_ in it, so I'd like to put it all in terraform, but I'm a busy woman, so... later.

## Local use

From the root directory, run:

```bash
make build
make up
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## CSV List Cutter

After uploading a CSV, select the columns to keep.

Columns can be filtered using SQL-like conditions, for example:

- `<= 20`
- `!= "NY"`
- `BETWEEN 50 AND 100`
- `IN ('Alice', 'Bob')`

The list cutter applies these conditions while streaming the CSV into a new CSV, which you can download, if that sparks joy.

## Type checking and query validation

~~There is none! Deal with it.~~ Coming soon ðŸ‘¼
