# ðŸ”¥ Massive Simplification Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the simplification of the list-cutter project from an over-engineered enterprise platform back to a simple CSV processing tool.

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment âœ…
- Identified 21 security service files (need 1)
- Found 7 caching implementations (need 0)
- Counted 14+ route files (need ~5)
- Discovered blue-green deployment for a CSV tool

## Phase 2: Security Simplification
Target: Merge 21 files â†’ 1 file
- Remove: threat intelligence, compliance, incident response, PII scanning
- Keep: JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation

## Phase 3: Remove Caching
Target: Delete all caching layers
- Remove: memory, edge, hybrid, multi-layer caches
- Keep: Basic HTTP cache headers only

## Phase 4: API Consolidation
Target: 14+ routes â†’ ~5 routes
- auth routes â†’ auth.ts
- file routes â†’ files.ts
- monitoring/metrics â†’ admin.ts

## Phase 5: Config Cleanup
- Merge wrangler configs
- Simplify environment variables
- Clean GitHub Actions

## Phase 6: Remove Deployment Complexity
- Remove blue-green deployment
- Simplify to basic deployment
