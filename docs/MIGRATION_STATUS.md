```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 5**: Begin R2 storage migration
   - Review phase-5-r2-migration.md
   - Create R2 buckets
   - Implement file upload/download with Workers bindings

2. **Phase 6**: Implement authentication & security
   - Review phase-6-auth-security.md
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Set up Workers KV for sessions

3. **Phase 7**: Testing & optimization
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Monitoring setup

## Technical Stack

### Current (Legacy)
- Backend: Django (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Neo4j
- File Storage: Local filesystem
- Frontend: React (served by Django)

### Target (Cloudflare)
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- File Storage: Cloudflare R2
- Frontend: React (served by Workers with static assets)
- Session Storage: Workers KV
- CDN: Cloudflare global network

## Benefits Achieved So Far

- âœ… Serverless architecture with global edge deployment
- âœ… Unified Workers serving both frontend and backend
- âœ… Zero cold starts with Workers
- âœ… Simplified deployment pipeline
- âœ… Cost reduction (pay-per-request model)
- âœ… Improved performance with edge computing
- âœ… Built-in DDoS protection and security

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Data Migration**: Comprehensive validation procedures in place
- **Feature Parity**: All Django endpoints successfully replicated
- **Performance**: Edge computing provides better global performance
- **Security**: Cloudflare's security features enhance protection
