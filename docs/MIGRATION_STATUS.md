## Phase 5 Follow-up Dependencies ⚠️

**CRITICAL**: Phase 5 completion has identified follow-up tasks that create dependencies for future phases.

### Critical Path Issues (Must Complete Before Future Phases)

**🔴 BLOCKING ALL PHASES:**
- **Issue #64 (CRITICAL)**: Missing D1 database tables for R2 operations
  - **Blocks**: All future phases - R2StorageService cannot function without database schema
  - **GitHub**: https://github.com/emily-flambe/list-cutter/issues/64
  - **Priority**: Complete immediately

**🟡 INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES:**
- **Issue #66 (HIGH)**: Create data migration tools for existing files to R2 storage
  - **Blocks**: Phase 8 (Deployment & Cutover) - production cannot access existing user data
  - **GitHub**: https://github.com/emily-flambe/list-cutter/issues/66

- **Issue #67 (HIGH)**: Implement comprehensive security measures for R2 file operations
  - **Integrates**: Phase 6 (Authentication & Security) - file access controls needed
  - **GitHub**: https://github.com/emily-flambe/list-cutter/issues/67

**📋 SUPPORTING TASKS:**
- **Issue #65**: R2 storage monitoring, alerting, and cost management
- **Issue #68**: Disaster recovery and backup procedures for R2 storage  
- **Issue #69**: Performance optimizations and caching for R2 file operations

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. **Week 1**: Issue #64 (Database tables) ← MUST BE FIRST
2. **Week 2**: Issue #67 (Security) + #65 (Monitoring) ← Support Phase 6
3. **Week 3**: Issue #66 (Migration tools) ← Required for Phase 8
4. **Week 4**: Issue #68 (Disaster recovery) + #69 (Performance) ← Production readiness

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete Issue #64 (Database tables) - BLOCKS everything else

2. **Phase 6**: Implement authentication & security (requires Issue #64, integrates with #67)
   - Review phase-6-auth-security.md
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Set up Workers KV for sessions

3. **Phase 7**: Testing & optimization (enhanced by Issues #65, #69)
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Monitoring setup

4. **Phase 8**: Deployment & cutover (requires Issue #66)
   - Production deployment
   - Data migration execution
   - DNS cutover

## Technical Stack

### Current (Legacy)
- Backend: Django (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Neo4j
- File Storage: Local filesystem
- Frontend: React (served by Django)

### Target (Cloudflare)
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- File Storage: Cloudflare R2
- Frontend: React (served by Workers with static assets)
- Session Storage: Workers KV
- CDN: Cloudflare global network

## Benefits Achieved So Far

- ✅ Serverless architecture with global edge deployment
- ✅ Unified Workers serving both frontend and backend
- ✅ Zero cold starts with Workers
- ✅ Simplified deployment pipeline
- ✅ Cost reduction (pay-per-request model)
- ✅ Improved performance with edge computing
- ✅ Built-in DDoS protection and security

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Data Migration**: Comprehensive validation procedures in place
- **Feature Parity**: All Django endpoints successfully replicated
- **Performance**: Edge computing provides better global performance
- **Security**: Cloudflare's security features enhance protection
