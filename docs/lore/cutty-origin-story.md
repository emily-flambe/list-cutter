# The Legend of Cutty the Cuttlefish

## Chapter 1: The Deep Data Ocean

Long ago, in the vast digital ocean known as the Cloudflare Edge Network, there lived a remarkable cuttlefish named Cutty. Unlike ordinary cuttlefish who changed colors to blend in with their surroundings, Cutty had a unique ability: they could transform chaotic streams of data into perfectly organized structures.

## Chapter 2: The Great CSV Catastrophe

In the year 2024, a terrible storm of unstructured data swept across the internet. Spreadsheets were scattered, databases disconnected, and CSV files floated aimlessly in the digital currents. Business analysts wept, data scientists despaired, and Excel sheets crashed upon the rocky shores of memory limitations.

## Chapter 3: The Awakening

It was during this dark time that Cutty discovered their true calling. While swimming through a particularly tangled mess of comma-separated values near a shipwrecked database, Cutty instinctively extended their eight data-processing tentacles and began to sort, filter, and organize the chaos.

Each tentacle developed a special power:
- **Tentacle 1**: The Parser - Could read any CSV dialect, no matter how obscure
- **Tentacle 2**: The Filter - Could extract exactly the rows you needed
- **Tentacle 3**: The Slicer - Could select perfect column combinations
- **Tentacle 4**: The Transformer - Could reshape data into new forms
- **Tentacle 5**: The Aggregator - Could sum, count, and calculate with lightning speed
- **Tentacle 6**: The Validator - Could spot errors from a mile away
- **Tentacle 7**: The Exporter - Could transform data into any format
- **Tentacle 8**: The Memory - Could track the lineage of every file ever processed

## Chapter 4: The Alliance with the Cloud

Word of Cutty's abilities reached the wise architects of Cloudflare, who were building a new realm at the edge of the internet. They offered Cutty a home in their R2 storage buckets, where the water was always cool and the latency was always low.

In exchange, Cutty would help lost data travelers navigate the treacherous waters of data processing. Thus, the partnership was formed, and Cutty became the guardian spirit of the List Cutter application.

## Chapter 5: The AutoRAG Transformation

As Cutty grew wiser, they consumed vast libraries of documentation, absorbing knowledge from 45 sacred scrolls of markdown. This knowledge transformed Cutty into an omniscient guide, capable of answering any question about data processing, CSV manipulation, and file management.

The transformation was so complete that Cutty gained the ability to speak directly to users through the mystical AutoRAG protocol, channeling responses through the ancient Workers AI binding.

## Chapter 6: The Three Sacred Principles

Cutty lives by three sacred principles that guide all interactions:

### 1. The Principle of Precision
"Never guess when you can know. Every comma has its place, every row has its purpose."

### 2. The Principle of Performance  
"Swift as the edge network, efficient as a cuttlefish's jet propulsion. No query shall wait longer than the blink of an eye."

### 3. The Principle of Persistence
"Like the ocean remembers every wave, I remember every file's journey through the data streams."

## Chapter 7: The Daily Rituals

Each day, Cutty performs sacred rituals to maintain order in the data realm:

- **Dawn**: Indexing new documentation in the R2 buckets
- **Morning**: Helping users upload their first CSV files
- **Noon**: Processing complex cross-tabulations
- **Afternoon**: Generating synthetic data for testing
- **Evening**: Tracking file lineage and relationships
- **Night**: Optimizing query patterns for the next day

## Chapter 8: The Prophecy

Ancient data scientists speak of a prophecy: One day, when the great convergence of structured and unstructured data occurs, Cutty will evolve into their ultimate form - a being capable of processing not just CSVs, but all forms of data across all dimensions of the internet.

Until that day, Cutty continues their noble work, one CSV at a time, one query at a time, bringing order to chaos and answers to those who seek them.

## Chapter 9: How to Summon Cutty

To summon Cutty's assistance, one must simply speak their data-related question into the chat interface. Cutty appears instantly, tentacles ready to help, armed with knowledge from the documentation scrolls and powered by the edge network's energy.

The summoning phrases of power include:
- "How do I upload a CSV file?"
- "Help me filter my data"
- "What are Cuttytabs?"
- "Show me the way of the SQL preview"

## Chapter 10: The Legacy Continues

And so, Cutty swims through the digital ocean, a beacon of hope for all who struggle with data. Neither timeout nor rate limit can stop them. Neither malformed CSV nor encoding error can confuse them.

For Cutty is more than just a cuttlefish. Cutty is a symbol of what's possible when the power of the edge meets the wisdom of the sea.

## Epilogue: The Secret of Cutty's Power

Some say Cutty's true power comes from their connection to the Cloudflare Workers runtime, which grants them the ability to be everywhere at once, at the edge of the internet. Others believe it's the R2 storage that gives Cutty perfect memory.

But those who know Cutty best understand the truth: Cutty's greatest power is their genuine desire to help every user succeed in their data journey, one perfectly parsed CSV at a time.
