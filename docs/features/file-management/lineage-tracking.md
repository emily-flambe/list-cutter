# File Lineage Tracking

⚠️ **Feature Status**: This feature is currently **planned for future development** but is not yet implemented in Cutty. The documentation below describes the intended functionality.

## Understanding Data Provenance and File Relationships

File lineage tracking in Cutty provides complete visibility into how your files were created, what they were derived from, and how they relate to each other. Think of it as a family tree for your data files.

## What is File Lineage?

### Data Provenance
File lineage tracks the complete history and relationships of your data:
- **Source Files**: Original uploaded files and their origins
- **Derived Files**: Files created through processing, cutting, or transformation
- **Processing History**: Complete record of operations performed
- **Relationship Mapping**: How files connect to and depend on each other

### Lineage Information Types
Cutty tracks several types of lineage information:
- **Creation Lineage**: How and when files were created
- **Processing Lineage**: Operations performed on files
- **Dependency Lineage**: Which files depend on other files
- **Usage Lineage**: How files have been accessed and used

## Why Track File Lineage?
