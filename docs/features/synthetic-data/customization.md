# Customizing Generated Data

Cutty's Synthetic Data Generator provides extensive customization options to create datasets that match your specific requirements. Learn how to configure parameters, select appropriate data fields, and optimize your synthetic data for different use cases.

## Basic Configuration Options

### Record Count Selection

#### Choosing the Right Volume
The number of records you generate should match your intended use case:

**Small Datasets (10-100 records)**
- **Use Cases**: Initial testing, UI development, proof of concepts
- **Advantages**: Fast generation, easy to review manually, minimal resource usage
- **Limitations**: May not represent full statistical diversity
- **Best For**: Early-stage development, simple feature testing

**Medium Datasets (100-1,000 records)**
- **Use Cases**: Integration testing, algorithm development, report design
- **Advantages**: Good statistical representation, manageable file sizes
- **Limitations**: May miss edge cases in large-scale scenarios
- **Best For**: Most development and testing scenarios

**Large Datasets (1,000-10,000 records)**
- **Use Cases**: Performance testing, machine learning training, comprehensive analysis
- **Advantages**: Full statistical representation, realistic performance characteristics
- **Limitations**: Longer generation time, larger file sizes
- **Best For**: Production testing, analytics development, training datasets

#### Setting Record Counts
1. **Default Selection**: Start with 100 records for general testing
2. **Performance Consideration**: Consider your system's processing capabilities
3. **Statistical Validity**: Ensure sufficient data for meaningful analysis
4. **Resource Planning**: Account for storage and processing requirements

### Geographic Targeting

#### State Selection Options

**Single State Generation**

**Multi-State Generation**
- **Purpose**: Represent broader geographic markets
- **Benefits**: Regional diversity while maintaining focus
- **Use Cases**: Multi-state businesses, regional comparisons
- **Configuration**: Select multiple states using checkboxes

**National Representation**
- **Purpose**: Create datasets representing entire US market
- **Benefits**: Maximum geographic diversity and representation
- **Use Cases**: National businesses, comprehensive market analysis
- **Configuration**: Select "All States" option

#### Geographic Consistency Features

**Automatic Address Matching**
- Cities are automatically selected from within chosen states
- ZIP codes correspond accurately to city and state combinations

- Realistic rural vs. urban distribution
- Economic patterns that match regional characteristics
- Cultural and demographic patterns appropriate for regions

## Advanced Customization Techniques

### Statistical Distribution Control

#### Age Distribution Customization
While Cutty uses realistic age distributions by default, you can influence patterns through state selection:

**Younger Populations**

- **Use Cases**: Technology companies, education services, entry-level market analysis

**Mature Populations**
- **States**: Florida, Maine, West Virginia (aging populations)
- **Characteristics**: Higher 55+ age group representation
- **Use Cases**: Healthcare services, retirement planning, mature market analysis

**Balanced Demographics**
- **States**: California, Illinois, Virginia (diverse age distributions)
- **Characteristics**: Even distribution across age groups
- **Use Cases**: General consumer markets, broad demographic analysis

#### Income Distribution Patterns
Different states naturally produce different income distribution patterns:

**Higher Income Regions**
- **States**: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland
- **Characteristics**: More high-income records, educated population
- **Use Cases**: Luxury markets, professional services, premium products

**Mixed Income Regions**
- **States**: Texas, California, Florida, New York
- **Characteristics**: Full spectrum income representation
- **Use Cases**: Mass market products, diverse customer analysis

**Moderate Income Regions**
- **States**: Midwest states, some Southern states
- **Characteristics**: Strong middle-income representation
- **Use Cases**: Middle-market products, regional business analysis

## Optimization Strategies

### Performance Optimization

#### Generation Speed
**Factors Affecting Speed**:
- Record count (linear impact)
- Number of states selected
- Geographic complexity requirements
- Data validation complexity

**Optimization Techniques**:
1. **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple smaller datasets rather than one large dataset
2. **State Limitation**: Limit to necessary states for faster processing
3. **Field Selection**: Include only required fields to reduce processing time
4. **Incremental Generation**: Build datasets incrementally as needed

#### Resource Management
**Memory Considerations**:
- Large datasets require more server memory
- Complex geographic validation increases memory usage
- Multiple concurrent generations share resources

**Best Practices**:
- Generate during off-peak hours for large datasets
- Download datasets promptly after generation
- Clear browser cache after large downloads
- Monitor generation progress for large requests

### Quality Optimization

#### Data Coherence
**Ensuring Logical Consistency**:
1. **Geographic Coherence**: Verify state-city-ZIP relationships
2. **Demographic Logic**: Check age-income-education correlations
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Ensure proper date sequencing
4. **Business Logic**: Validate customer lifecycle patterns

**Quality Validation Steps**:
1. **Sample Review**: Manually inspect first 10-20 records
2. **Statistical Check**: Verify distributions match expectations
3. **Relationship Validation**: Test key field relationships
4. **Edge Case Review**: Look for unrealistic combinations

#### Realistic Patterns
**Enhancing Realism**:
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Registration dates show business seasonality
- **Geographic Clustering**: Customer concentrations in urban areas
- **Economic Correlation**: Income levels match regional patterns
- **Behavioral Logic**: Customer segments align with demographics
