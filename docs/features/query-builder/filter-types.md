# Filter Types Guide

## Complete Reference for All Filter Types

The Query Builder supports different filter types optimized for different kinds of data. Understanding which filter type to use for your data will help you create more effective and efficient queries.

## Understanding Filter Types

### What are Filter Types?
Filter types are specialized filtering interfaces designed for specific data types. Each type provides operators and input methods optimized for that kind of data:
- **Text Filters**: For names, descriptions, categories, and string data
- **Numeric Filters**: For numbers, amounts, quantities, and measurements
- **Date Filters**: For timestamps, dates, and time periods
- **Boolean Filters**: For true/false, yes/no, and binary data
- **List Filters**: For selecting from predefined values

### Automatic Type Detection
Cutty automatically detects the best filter type for each column:
- **Content Analysis**: Examines sample values to determine type
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies dates, numbers, and text patterns
- **Manual Override**: Option to change detected type if needed
- **Mixed Data Handling**: Graceful handling of columns with multiple data types

## Text Filters

### Overview
Text filters are designed for working with string data like names, descriptions, categories, and identifiers.

### Available Operators

- **Whitespace Only**: Strings with only spaces/tabs
- **Default Values**: Specified placeholder values

## Filter Performance Considerations

### Optimized Filter Types

#### Fast Filters
Generally high-performance:
- **Exact equality** on indexed columns
- **Numeric comparisons** on indexed columns
- **Date ranges** on indexed date columns
- **Boolean filters** on indexed boolean columns

#### Moderate Performance
Reasonable performance with some cost:
- **Text contains** on moderate-length text
- **List membership** with small lists
- **Date ranges** on non-indexed columns
- **Numeric ranges** on non-indexed columns

#### Potentially Slow Filters
Use carefully with large datasets:
- **Text pattern matching** with wildcards
- **Regular expressions** on large text fields
- **Complex statistical** calculations
- **Large list membership** tests

### Performance Optimization Tips

#### Index-Friendly Filtering
- Use exact matches on indexed columns when possible
- Prefer range queries on indexed numeric/date columns
- Combine multiple filters to increase selectivity
- Test filter performance on representative data

#### Filter Ordering
- Apply most selective filters first
- Use faster filter types before slower ones
- Consider filter combination efficiency
- Monitor query execution times

## Common Filter Combinations

### Customer Segmentation
```
Text Filter: Customer Type = "Premium"
AND Numeric Filter: Lifetime Value > 10000
AND Date Filter: Last Purchase < 90 days ago
Result: High-value recent premium customers
```

### Data Quality Auditing
```
Text Filter: Email Does Not Contain "@"
OR Text Filter: Phone Number Is Empty
OR Date Filter: Created Date > Today
Result: Records with data quality issues
```

### Sales Analysis
```
Date Filter: Sale Date This Quarter
AND Numeric Filter: Amount > 1000
AND Text Filter: Region In ["North", "South"]
Result: High-value regional sales this quarter
```

### Compliance Filtering
```
Text Filter: Country In [EU Countries List]
AND Date Filter: Consent Date >= 2018-05-25
AND Boolean Filter: Marketing Opt In = True
Result: GDPR-compliant marketing contacts
```

## Troubleshooting Filter Types

### Common Issues

#### Wrong Data Type Detected
**Problem**: Column detected as wrong type
**Solution**: 
1. Check sample data in column
2. Use manual type override
3. Clean data before upload
4. Use text filter for mixed-type columns

#### Filter Not Working as Expected
**Problem**: Filter produces wrong results
**Solution**:
1. Verify operator selection
2. Check case sensitivity settings
3. Test with known data values
4. Review data format consistency

#### Poor Performance
**Problem**: Filter is very slow
**Solution**:
1. Use more selective filters first
2. Consider adding database indexes
3. Simplify complex patterns
4. Test with smaller data samples

## Best Practices

### Filter Design
1. **Match Data Type**: Use appropriate filter type for your data
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic operators, add complexity gradually
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify filters work with edge cases
4. **Consider Performance**: Choose efficient filter combinations

### Data Preparation
1. **Consistent Formats**: Standardize data formats before filtering
2. **Clean Data**: Remove or fix data quality issues
3. **Document Types**: Understand your data types and patterns
4. **Index Strategy**: Consider database indexing for frequently filtered columns

### Query Optimization
1. **Selective First**: Apply most selective filters early
2. **Fast Operations**: Use equality and range filters when possible
3. **Avoid Patterns**: Minimize wildcard and regex use
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track filter execution times
