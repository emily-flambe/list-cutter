# Cuttytabs Overview

Cuttytabs is Cutty's powerful cross-tabulation analysis feature that helps you discover patterns and relationships in your data by creating pivot-style tables that show how different variables relate to each other.

## What is Cross-Tabulation?

Cross-tabulation (crosstab) is a statistical technique that displays the relationship between two or more categorical variables in a table format. It shows how the values of one variable are distributed across the values of another variable.

Think of it as a smart way to count and group your data to answer questions like:
- "How many customers in each region bought each product?"
- "What's the relationship between age groups and purchasing behavior?"
- "How do survey responses vary by demographic categories?"

## Key Features

### Interactive Analysis
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Easy selection of row and column variables
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant table generation as you change variables
- **Multiple File Support**: Works with your uploaded CSV files and demo datasets
- **Flexible Data Types**: Handles text, numbers, and categorical data

### Rich Aggregation Options
- **Count**: How many records fall into each combination
- **Sum**: Total values for numeric fields
- **Average**: Mean values across groups
- **Percentage**: Proportional distribution analysis
- **Custom Calculations**: Derived metrics and ratios

### Export and Sharing
- **CSV Export**: Download crosstab results for further analysis
- **Formatted Tables**: Clean, readable table layouts
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: Easy sharing with stakeholders
- **Print-Friendly**: Professional formatting for reports

## How Cuttytabs Works

### The Process
1. **Select Data Source**: Choose from your uploaded files or demo datasets
2. **Pick Row Variable**: What categories should appear as rows
3. **Pick Column Variable**: What categories should appear as columns  
4. **Choose Aggregation**: How to calculate values (count, sum, average, etc.)
5. **Generate Table**: View your cross-tabulation results instantly
6. **Export Results**: Download or share your findings

### Behind the Scenes
Cuttytabs processes your data using advanced crosstab algorithms that:
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Maintain data accuracy throughout calculations
- Generate SQL-compatible queries for technical users

- **Temporary Processing**: Analysis data is not permanently stored
- **Access Control**: User authentication for sensitive data

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Navigate to Cuttytabs**: Use the sidebar menu to access the feature
2. **Choose Demo Data**: Start with the built-in squirrel dataset to learn
3. **Select Variables**: Pick "Primary Fur Color" for rows and "Age" for columns
4. **View Results**: See how fur colors are distributed across age groups
5. **Export**: Download your first crosstab analysis

### Best Practices
- **Start Simple**: Begin with two clear categorical variables
- **Check Data Quality**: Review your source data for consistency
- **Meaningful Variables**: Choose variables that logically relate to each other
- **Interpret Thoughtfully**: Consider what the patterns in your crosstab mean
- **Validate Results**: Cross-check findings with other analysis methods

Cuttytabs transforms raw data into actionable insights by revealing hidden patterns and relationships, making it an essential tool for data-driven decision making.
