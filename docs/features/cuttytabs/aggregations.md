## Percentage Aggregation

### What Percentage Shows

Percentage aggregation converts raw counts into **proportional distributions**, making it easier to compare relative frequencies and identify patterns.

### Types of Percentage Calculations

#### Row Percentages
Shows distribution within each row (how each row total is distributed across columns):
```
Row % = (Cell Value / Row Total) × 100
```

#### Column Percentages
Shows distribution within each column (how each column total is distributed across rows):
```
Column % = (Cell Value / Column Total) × 100
```

#### Table Percentages
Shows each cell as percentage of grand total:
```
Table % = (Cell Value / Grand Total) × 100
```

### When to Use Percentages

#### Market Share Analysis
Compare relative performance:
- Product market share by region
- Channel effectiveness by customer segment
- Competitive positioning by product category

#### Composition Analysis
Understand how totals break down:
