# Pivot Table Functionality

Cuttytabs provides powerful pivot table capabilities that go beyond basic cross-tabulation, allowing you to reshape, aggregate, and analyze your data from multiple perspectives.

## Understanding Pivot Operations

### What Makes Cuttytabs a Pivot Tool

While traditional crosstabs show simple counts, Cuttytabs' pivot functionality allows you to:

- **Aggregate Different Metrics**: Sum, average, count, and calculate percentages
- **Handle Multiple Data Types**: Work with numeric, text, and date variables
- **Dynamic Reshaping**: Instantly change table structure by swapping variables
- **Complex Calculations**: Perform mathematical operations across groups
- **Percentage Analysis**: View data as proportions and percentages

### Pivot vs. Traditional Crosstab

| Feature | Traditional Crosstab | Cuttytabs Pivot |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Basic Counts | ✓ | ✓ |
| Sum Values | ✗ | ✓ |
| Calculate Averages | ✗ | ✓ |
| Percentage Views | Limited | ✓ |
| Multiple Aggregations | ✗ | ✓ |
| Numeric Analysis | ✗ | ✓ |

## Aggregation Methods

### Count Operations

**Count** is the default and most basic aggregation method.

#### Use Cases
- **Frequency Analysis**: How often each combination occurs
- **Distribution Patterns**: Spread of categorical variables
- **Sample Sizes**: Understanding data availability across groups

#### Example
Question: "How many customers are in each region by customer type?"

| Customer Type | East | West | North | South | Total |
|---------------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Premium       | 45   | 38   | 29    | 33    | 145   |
| Standard      | 67   | 55   | 48    | 52    | 222   |
| Basic         | 23   | 19   | 15    | 18    | 75    |

### Sum Operations

**Sum** aggregates numeric values across categories.

#### Use Cases
- **Revenue Analysis**: Total sales by region and product
- **Resource Allocation**: Total hours or costs by department and project
- **Performance Metrics**: Cumulative scores or quantities

#### Example
Question: "What are total sales by product category and quarter?"

| Product Category | Q1     | Q2     | Q3     | Q4     | Total  |
|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Electronics      | 125,000| 138,000| 142,000| 165,000| 570,000|
| Clothing         | 89,000 | 95,000 | 88,000 | 112,000| 384,000|
| Home & Garden    | 67,000 | 78,000 | 85,000 | 91,000 | 321,000|

### Average Operations

**Average** calculates mean values for numeric data.

#### Use Cases
- **Performance Analysis**: Average scores by group
- **Pricing Analysis**: Mean prices across categories
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Average processing times or completion rates

#### Example
Question: "What's the average order value by customer segment and payment method?"

| Customer Segment | Credit Card | PayPal | Bank Transfer | Cash |
|------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|------|
| Enterprise       | $2,450      | $2,180 | $2,890        | $1,950|
| Small Business   | $890        | $750   | $1,120        | $680 |
| Individual       | $340        | $290   | $410          | $280 |

## Advanced Pivot Techniques

### Dynamic Variable Swapping

One of Cuttytabs' most powerful features is the ability to instantly reshape your analysis by swapping row and column variables.

#### How to Swap Variables
1. **Current Analysis**: Start with any crosstab (e.g., Department vs Performance)
2. **Mental Flip**: Imagine how the table would look with variables swapped
3. **Quick Change**: Use dropdowns to swap row and column selections
4. **Instant Results**: Table immediately reshapes with new perspective

#### When to Use Variable Swapping
- **Readability**: Swap when one orientation is easier to read
- **Pattern Recognition**: Different orientations reveal different patterns
- **Presentation**: Choose orientation that best supports your narrative
- **Space Constraints**: Fit tables into available presentation space

### Multi-Level Analysis

#### Hierarchical Grouping
Create nested analysis by using related variables:

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with high-level categories (Region)
2. **Add Detail**: Drill down with related variables (City within Region)
3. **Multiple Tables**: Create separate crosstabs for each level
4. **Compare Patterns**: Look for consistency across hierarchy levels

#### Time-Series Pivots
Use date-related variables for temporal analysis:

- **Year-over-Year**: Compare same periods across different years
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Month or quarter analysis within years
- **Trend Analysis**: Sequential time periods to identify trends
- **Cyclical Patterns**: Day of week or hour of day analysis

### Complex Aggregation Scenarios

#### Mixed Data Types
Handle datasets with both categorical and numeric variables:

1. **Categorical Grouping**: Use text variables for rows/columns
2. **Numeric Aggregation**: Sum or average numeric values within groups
3. **Meaningful Combinations**: Ensure your groups make analytical sense
4. **Validate Results**: Check that aggregations are mathematically sound

#### Percentage Analysis

Transform counts into meaningful proportions:

#### Row Percentages
Shows distribution within each row:
```
Each cell = (Cell Value / Row Total) × 100
```

#### Column Percentages  
Shows distribution within each column:
```
Each cell = (Cell Value / Column Total) × 100
```

#### Total Percentages
Shows each cell as percentage of grand total:
```
Each cell = (Cell Value / Grand Total) × 100
```

## Best Practices for Pivot Analysis

### Planning Your Pivot Strategy

#### Define Clear Objectives
1. **Specific Questions**: What exactly do you want to learn?
2. **Key Metrics**: Which numbers matter most for your analysis?
3. **Audience Needs**: Who will use these insights and how?
4. **Action Orientation**: How will results influence decisions?

#### Choose Appropriate Variables
1. **Logical Relationships**: Ensure variables have meaningful connections
2. **Balanced Categories**: Avoid variables with too many or too few unique values
3. **Data Quality**: Check for consistent formatting and missing values
4. **Aggregation Suitability**: Ensure numeric variables are appropriate for chosen operations

### Optimization Techniques

#### Performance Considerations
1. **Data Size**: Large datasets may take longer to process
2. **Variable Cardinality**: Variables with many unique values slow processing
3. **Pre-filtering**: Apply filters before pivot analysis when possible
4. **Incremental Analysis**: Start simple, then add complexity gradually

#### Accuracy Validation
1. **Spot Checks**: Manually verify a few calculations
2. **Total Reconciliation**: Ensure totals match expected values
3. **Logic Tests**: Check that results make business sense
4. **Cross-validation**: Compare with other analysis methods

### Presentation and Communication

#### Table Design
1. **Clear Headers**: Use descriptive variable names
2. **Logical Ordering**: Arrange categories in meaningful sequence
3. **Appropriate Precision**: Round numbers to appropriate decimal places
4. **Highlight Insights**: Use formatting to draw attention to key findings

#### Storytelling with Pivots
1. **Context Setting**: Explain what the table shows and why it matters
2. **Pattern Highlighting**: Point out the most important insights
3. **Actionable Conclusions**: Connect findings to potential actions
4. **Limitation Acknowledgment**: Note any caveats or data limitations

The pivot functionality in Cuttytabs transforms simple data tables into powerful analytical tools, enabling you to uncover insights that would be difficult or impossible to see in raw data. Master these techniques to become more effective at data-driven decision making.
