# Issue #66: File Data Migration Tools - Technical Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Required for Phase 8 deployment)
**Estimated Duration**: 4 days
**Dependencies**: Issue #64 (Database Schema) must be completed first
**Risk Level**: High (failure blocks production deployment)

## Problem Statement
While basic migration tools exist (`migrate_to_r2.py`, `assess_file_migration.py`, `validate_migration.py`), they lack production-ready features needed for safe, zero-downtime migration of Django files to R2 storage. This creates a critical blocker for Phase 8 deployment.

## Technical Analysis

### Current State
- ✅ **Basic migration scripts exist**: `scripts/migrate_to_r2.py`, `scripts/assess_file_migration.py`
- ✅ **Validation capabilities**: `scripts/validate_migration.py` with integrity checking
- ❌ **Production orchestration**: No coordinated migration process
- ❌ **Zero-downtime strategy**: No plan for seamless cutover
- ❌ **Comprehensive rollback**: Limited rollback capabilities
- ❌ **Progress monitoring**: Basic progress tracking needs enhancement

### Migration Complexity Assessment
Based on analysis, the migration must handle:
- **Django FileField/ImageField files** stored in local filesystem
- **User-uploaded files** with various formats and sizes
- **Database metadata** synchronization with R2 storage
- **File permissions** and access control preservation
- **Audit trail** maintenance during migration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Production Migration Architecture (Day 1)

#### Task 1.1: Create Production Migration Orchestrator
**File**: `scripts/production_migration_orchestrator.py`

```python
# Core components needed:
class ProductionMigrationOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.migration_state = MigrationState()
        self.integrity_checker = IntegrityChecker()
        self.rollback_manager = RollbackManager()
        self.progress_tracker = ProgressTracker()
        self.notification_service = NotificationService()
    
    def execute_migration(self, migration_plan):
        """Execute production migration with comprehensive safeguards"""
        
    def validate_pre_migration(self):
        """Validate environment before migration"""
        
    def monitor_migration_progress(self):
        """Real-time monitoring and alerting"""
        
    def handle_migration_failure(self):
        """Automated failure recovery and rollback"""
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **State Management**: Track migration progress with database persistence
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic rollback on critical failures
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress updates and notifications
- **Validation Gates**: Pre-migration, mid-migration, and post-migration validation

#### Task 1.2: Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy
**Strategy**: Dual-write approach with gradual cutover

```python
# Migration phases:
# Phase 1: Setup dual-write (write to both Django storage and R2)
# Phase 2: Migrate existing files while maintaining dual-write
# Phase 3: Switch read operations to R2 (with fallback to Django)
# Phase 4: Validate all operations work from R2
# Phase 5: Disable Django storage writes (R2 becomes primary)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Dual-Write Setup**: Configure Django to write to both storage systems
2. **Background Migration**: Migrate existing files without affecting live operations
3. **Read Cutover**: Switch read operations to R2 with Django fallback
4. **Write Cutover**: Make R2 primary storage system
5. **Cleanup**: Remove Django storage after validation period

#### Task 1.3: Migration State Management
**File**: `scripts/migration_state_manager.py`

```python
class MigrationState:
    """Persistent state management for migration process"""
    
    def __init__(self):

        self.create_state_tables()
    
    def create_state_tables(self):
        """Create tables for tracking migration state"""
        # migration_batches: Track file batches
        # migration_errors: Track and categorize errors
        # migration_checkpoints: Recovery points
        # migration_metrics: Performance and progress metrics
    
    def save_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_name, data):
        """Save migration checkpoint for recovery"""
        
    def load_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_name):
        """Load migration checkpoint for resumption"""
