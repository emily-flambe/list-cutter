# Phase 5.5: Critical R2 Follow-up Tasks

## Overview

This phase addresses the 6 critical follow-up tasks from Phase 5 R2 Storage Migration that are blocking progress on subsequent phases. These tasks were identified as essential for production readiness and must be completed before proceeding with authentication, testing, and deployment phases.

## Critical Blockers (Must Complete First)

### Issue #64: Missing D1 Database Schema for R2 Operations
**Status:** CRITICAL - Blocks all other work
**Priority:** Complete immediately

**Problem:** The R2StorageService references database tables that don't exist in the current D1 schema.

**Required Tables:**
```sql
-- Files table for metadata
CREATE TABLE files (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    r2_key TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    checksum TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Multipart uploads tracking
CREATE TABLE multipart_uploads (
    upload_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    file_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    r2_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    total_size INTEGER,
    parts_uploaded INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    session_data TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    completed_at DATETIME
);

-- File access audit logs
CREATE TABLE file_access_logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    file_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT,
    bytes_transferred INTEGER,
    duration_ms INTEGER,
    ip_address TEXT,
    user_agent TEXT,
    metadata TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create migration file in `cloudflare/workers/migrations/0005_r2_storage_tables.sql`
2. Update wrangler.toml to enable D1 database bindings
3. Test R2StorageService with new schema
4. Validate all file operations

### Issue #66: File Data Migration Tools
**Status:** CRITICAL - Required for Phase 8 deployment
**Priority:** High

**Problem:** No migration path exists for moving existing Django files to R2.

**Required Tools:**
- File migration assessment scripts
- Batch migration with integrity verification
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Rollback capabilities

**Implementation:**
1. Enhance existing `scripts/migrate_to_r2.py` with production features
2. Create validation and rollback scripts
3. Test migration process with production data replica
4. Document migration procedures

## High Priority Tasks

### Issue #65: R2 Storage Monitoring & Alerting
**Status:** Essential for production operations
**Priority:** High

**Implementation:**
1. Create monitoring dashboard for R2 operations
2. Set up alerting for cost spikes and performance issues
3. Implement usage tracking and reporting
4. Add user-facing storage usage display

### Issue #67: Production Security Hardening
**Status:** Critical for Phase 6 integration
**Priority:** High

**Implementation:**
1. Implement file access control middleware
2. Add comprehensive file validation
3. Implement user quota management
4. Create audit logging for all file operations

## Supporting Tasks

### Issue #68: Disaster Recovery & Backup
**Status:** Important for business continuity
**Priority:** Medium

**Implementation:**
1. Automated backup system for R2 data
2. Disaster recovery procedures
3. Data export capabilities
4. Health monitoring with degraded mode

### Issue #69: Performance Optimization
**Status:** Improves user experience
**Priority:** Medium

**Implementation:**
1. Multi-layer caching strategy
2. File compression and optimization
3. Pre-signed URL generation
4. Performance monitoring

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Database Work
- **Days 1-2:** Complete Issue #64 (Database tables) - CRITICAL
- **Days 3-4:** Begin Issue #66 (Migration tools)
- **Day 5:** Testing and validation

### Week 2: Security and Monitoring
- **Days 1-2:** Complete Issue #67 (Security hardening)
- **Days 3-4:** Implement Issue #65 (Monitoring)
- **Day 5:** Integration testing

### Week 3: Production Readiness
- **Days 1-2:** Complete Issue #66 (Migration tools)
- **Days 3-4:** Implement Issue #68 (Disaster recovery)
- **Day 5:** Final testing and validation

### Week 4: Performance and Polish
- **Days 1-3:** Implement Issue #69 (Performance optimization)
- **Days 4-5:** Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Success Criteria

**Phase 5.5 Complete When:**
- [ ] All database tables created and tested (Issue #64)
- [ ] File migration tools ready for production (Issue #66)
- [ ] Security hardening implemented (Issue #67)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational (Issue #65)
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures tested (Issue #68)
- [ ] Performance optimizations validated (Issue #69)

## Dependencies for Future Phases

**Phase 6 (Authentication):** Requires Issues #64, #67
**Phase 7 (Testing):** Requires Issues #64, #65, #69
**Phase 8 (Deployment):** Requires Issues #64, #66, #68
**Phase 9 (Cleanup):** Requires all issues completed

## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk:** Issue #64 blocks everything - prioritize immediately
**Medium Risk:** Issue #66 blocks deployment - must complete before Phase 8
**Low Risk:** Issues #68, #69 can be completed in parallel with other phases

This phase is essential for a successful production migration and must be completed before proceeding with the remaining phases.
