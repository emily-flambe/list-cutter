# List Cutter Migration Plans

This directory contains the phased migration plans for transitioning the List Cutter application from Django/PostgreSQL/Neo4j to a fully Cloudflare-native architecture.

## Active Plans (Phases 5-9)

These are the remaining phases to complete the migration:

- **[Phase 5: R2 Storage Migration](phase-5-r2-migration.md)** - Migrate file storage to Cloudflare R2
- **[Phase 6: Authentication & Security](phase-6-auth-security.md)** - Implement JWT auth and security features
- **[Phase 7: Testing & Optimization](phase-7-testing-optimization.md)** - Comprehensive testing and performance optimization
- **[Phase 8: Deployment & Cutover](phase-8-deployment-cutover.md)** - Production deployment and DNS cutover
- **[Phase 9: Cleanup](phase-9-cleanup.md)** - Remove legacy code and finalize documentation

## Completed Plans

See the [done/](done/) folder for completed phase plans and documentation.

## Migration Status

For a complete overview of the migration progress, see [../MIGRATION_STATUS.md](../MIGRATION_STATUS.md)

## Phase 5 Follow-up Dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL**: Phase 5 (R2 Storage Migration) has identified follow-up tasks that create dependencies for future phases. See [GitHub Issues #64-69](https://github.com/emily-flambe/list-cutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aphase-5-followup) for complete details.

### Critical Path Requirements

**üî¥ BLOCKERS - Must Complete Before Other Phases:**
- **Issue #64 (CRITICAL)**: Missing D1 database tables for R2 operations
  - **BLOCKS**: All future phases - database tables required for R2StorageService
  - **Priority**: Complete immediately

**üü° INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES:**
- **Issue #66 (HIGH)**: Data migration tools for existing files
  - **BLOCKS**: Phase 8 (Deployment & Cutover) - required for production data access
- **Issue #67 (HIGH)**: Comprehensive security measures for R2 operations  
  - **INTEGRATES**: Phase 6 (Authentication & Security) - file access controls needed

**üìã RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:**
1. **Week 1**: Issue #64 (Database tables) ‚Üê MUST BE FIRST
2. **Week 2**: Issue #67 (Security) + #65 (Monitoring) ‚Üê Support Phase 6
3. **Week 3**: Issue #66 (Migration tools) ‚Üê Required for Phase 8
4. **Week 4**: Issue #68 (Disaster recovery) + #69 (Performance) ‚Üê Production readiness

See individual phase plans below for specific integration points and requirements.

## Architecture

The migration follows a unified Cloudflare Workers architecture where a single Worker serves both the React frontend and API backend, leveraging:
- **D1** for database (SQLite)
- **R2** for object storage
- **Workers KV** for session management
- **Static Assets** for serving the React app

This approach simplifies deployment, reduces latency, and maximizes the benefits of Cloudflare's edge network.
