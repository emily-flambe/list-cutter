# List Cutter Migration Plans

This directory contains the phased migration plans for transitioning the List Cutter application from Django/PostgreSQL/Neo4j to a fully Cloudflare-native architecture.

## Active Plans (Phases 5-9)

These are the remaining phases to complete the migration:

- **[Phase 5: R2 Storage Migration](phase-5-r2-migration.md)** - Migrate file storage to Cloudflare R2
- **[Phase 6: Authentication & Security](phase-6-auth-security.md)** - Implement JWT auth and security features
- **[Phase 7: Testing & Optimization](phase-7-testing-optimization.md)** - Comprehensive testing and performance optimization
- **[Phase 8: Deployment & Cutover](phase-8-deployment-cutover.md)** - Production deployment and DNS cutover
- **[Phase 9: Cleanup](phase-9-cleanup.md)** - Remove legacy code and finalize documentation

## Completed Plans

See the [done/](done/) folder for completed phase plans and documentation.

## Legacy Planning Documents

The [legacy-planning/](legacy-planning/) folder contains earlier detailed implementation plans that were superseded by the Workers-integrated approach.

## Migration Status

For a complete overview of the migration progress, see [../MIGRATION_STATUS.md](../MIGRATION_STATUS.md)

## Architecture

The migration follows a unified Cloudflare Workers architecture where a single Worker serves both the React frontend and API backend, leveraging:
- **D1** for database (SQLite)
- **R2** for object storage
- **Workers KV** for session management
- **Static Assets** for serving the React app

This approach simplifies deployment, reduces latency, and maximizes the benefits of Cloudflare's edge network.
