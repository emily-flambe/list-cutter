- Phase 6: Authentication & Security (updated)
- Phase 7: Testing & Optimization (updated)
- Phase 8: Deployment & Cutover (updated)
- Phase 9: Cleanup & Documentation (updated)

## Next Stage Plans

### **[Phase 5.5: Critical R2 Follow-up Tasks](phase-5.5-critical-r2-followup.md)** 
**Status:** CRITICAL - Must complete before all other phases
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Issues:** #64 (CRITICAL), #65, #66, #67, #68, #69

**Status:** Ready after Phase 5.5 Issues #64, #67 complete  
**Duration:** 3 weeks
**Focus:** JWT auth with R2 integration, security hardening

### **[Phase 7: Testing & Optimization - Updated](phase-7-testing-optimization-updated.md)**
**Status:** Ready after Phases 5.5 and 6 complete
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Focus:** Complete test suite, performance optimization, CI/CD

### **[Phase 8: Deployment & Cutover - Updated](phase-8-deployment-cutover-updated.md)**
**Status:** Ready after Phases 5.5, 6, and 7 complete
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Focus:** Production deployment, data migration, zero-downtime cutover

### **[Phase 9: Cleanup & Documentation - Updated](phase-9-cleanup-updated.md)**
**Status:** Ready after Phase 8 complete
**Duration:** 4 weeks

  - **BLOCKS:** All subsequent phases
  - **PRIORITY:** Complete immediately

**ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY:**
- **Issue #66:** File migration tools - Required for Phase 8
- **Issue #67:** Security hardening - Required for Phase 6

## Implementation Timeline

```
Total Duration: 19 weeks (4.75 months)

Weeks 1-4:   Phase 5.5 - Critical R2 Follow-up Tasks
Weeks 5-7:   Phase 6 - Authentication & Security  
Weeks 8-11:  Phase 7 - Testing & Optimization
Weeks 12-15: Phase 8 - Deployment & Cutover
Weeks 16-19: Phase 9 - Cleanup & Documentation
```

## Master Plan

See **[Next Stage Development Plan](../../NEXT_STAGE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)** for comprehensive overview, resource requirements, risk assessment, and success metrics.

## Completed Plans Archive

See the [done/](done/) folder for completed phase plans and documentation.

## Architecture Overview

The migration delivers a unified Cloudflare Workers architecture where a single Worker serves both the React frontend and API backend, leveraging:
- **D1** for database (SQLite)
- **R2** for object storage
- **Workers KV** for session management
- **Static Assets** for serving the React app

This approach simplifies deployment, reduces latency, and maximizes the benefits of Cloudflare's edge network.
