## Introduction

This feature introduces "Cutty the Cuttlefish," an AI-powered chatbot that helps users understand and navigate the functionality available in the Cutty app. The chatbot will integrate with an existing Cloudflare AI worker (separate project at https://github.com/emily-flambe/cloudflare-ai-worker) that runs Llama3, and will provide contextual assistance about app features, usage guidance, and general support.

5. WHEN a user closes the chatbot THEN the system SHALL preserve the conversation history for the session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Cutty app to securely communicate with the existing Cloudflare AI worker, so that the chatbot functionality works reliably across both projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria
