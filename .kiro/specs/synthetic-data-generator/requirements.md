# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide a synthetic data generation capability for the list-cutter application, allowing users to create realistic but fake voter file data for testing, development, and demonstration purposes. The generated data will include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other typical voter file attributes while ensuring all information is completely synthetic and not tied to real individuals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or tester, I want to generate synthetic voter file data, so that I can test the application's functionality without using real personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests synthetic data generation THEN the system SHALL create fake voter records with realistic but completely synthetic personal information
2. WHEN generating data THEN the system SHALL include typical voter file fields such as first name, last name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address
3. WHEN creating synthetic data THEN the system SHALL ensure all generated information is clearly fake and not associated with real individuals
4. WHEN generating records THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify the number of records to create (with reasonable limits)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the synthetic data to look realistic, so that it provides meaningful testing scenarios for the application's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating names THEN the system SHALL use diverse, realistic-sounding first and last names from various cultural backgrounds
2. WHEN creating addresses THEN the system SHALL generate plausible street addresses, cities, states, and ZIP codes that follow proper formatting conventions
3. WHEN generating contact information THEN the system SHALL create properly formatted phone numbers and email addresses
4. WHEN creating voter data THEN the system SHALL include additional realistic fields like voter ID numbers, registration dates, and party affiliations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download the synthetic data in CSV format, so that I can use it with the existing list-cutting functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synthetic data is generated THEN the system SHALL provide the data in CSV format compatible with the existing file upload system
2. WHEN downloading synthetic data THEN the system SHALL include proper CSV headers that match expected voter file column names
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL ensure the CSV file is properly formatted and can be immediately used with the app's existing features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the synthetic data generation, so that I can create data sets that match my specific testing needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating data THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify geographic focus (e.g., specific states or regions)
2. WHEN creating records THEN the system SHALL provide options for different data distributions (age ranges, party affiliations, etc.)
3. WHEN generating synthetic data THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose which fields to include in the output
4. IF a user specifies invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and default to reasonable values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure synthetic data generation doesn't impact system performance, so that the feature can be used safely in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and resource management
2. WHEN processing generation requests THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
3. WHEN multiple users request data generation THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
4. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup any partial data
