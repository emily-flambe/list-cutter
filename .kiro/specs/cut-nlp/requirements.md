# Requirements Document - CUT Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

The CUT Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature extends the dynamic query builder with natural language capabilities, allowing users to describe their data filtering and analysis needs in plain English rather than manually building filters. This feature leverages AI to interpret user intent and translate natural language queries into structured filter configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to describe data queries in natural language, so that I can analyze data without learning complex filter syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN natural language processing is enabled THEN the system SHALL accept queries like "show me all customers from California with orders over $1000"
2. WHEN processing natural language THEN the system SHALL translate the query into appropriate filter configurations
3. WHEN ambiguous queries are submitted THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification or suggest alternatives
4. WHEN natural language fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the manual filter builder
5. WHEN learning from usage THEN the system SHALL improve natural language understanding over time
