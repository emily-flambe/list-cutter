# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables logged-in users to manage CSV files they have created within Cutty through a basic file management system. The system will provide users with the ability to view, download, and delete their files, with future support for file preview capabilities. Files are stored securely in Cloudflare R2 and are associated with the authenticated user who created them.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view a list of all CSV files I have created, so that I can see what files are available for management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user navigates to the file management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all CSV files associated with their user account
2. WHEN displaying the file list THEN the system SHALL show file name, creation date, and file size for each file
3. WHEN no files exist for the user THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the file list loads THEN the system SHALL sort files by creation date with newest files first

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to download any of my CSV files, so that I can access the data locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the download button for a file THEN the system SHALL initiate a download of the CSV file
2. WHEN downloading a file THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns the file before allowing download
3. WHEN a download is initiated THEN the system SHALL serve the file with appropriate headers for CSV download
4. IF a file no longer exists in storage THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remove the file from the list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to delete CSV files I no longer need, so that I can manage my storage usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the delete button for a file THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
2. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the file from both R2 storage and the database
3. WHEN a file is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL update the file list to reflect the removal
4. WHEN a user attempts to delete a file THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns the file before allowing deletion
5. IF deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the file in the list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want the file management system to only work with CSV files, so that the system remains focused and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying files THEN the system SHALL only show files with CSV format
2. WHEN storing file metadata THEN the system SHALL record the file type as CSV
3. WHEN serving downloads THEN the system SHALL set the content-type header to text/csv
4. WHEN validating file operations THEN the system SHALL ensure only CSV files are processed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my files to be securely associated with my account, so that other users cannot access my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL associate each file with the authenticated user's ID
2. WHEN retrieving files THEN the system SHALL only return files owned by the requesting user
3. WHEN performing file operations THEN the system SHALL validate user ownership before allowing access
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login before allowing file management access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want the file management interface to be accessible from the main navigation, so that I can easily find and use this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display a "Manage Files" option in the main navigation
2. WHEN a user clicks "Manage Files" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the file management page
3. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Manage Files" navigation option
4. WHEN on the file management page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current page in the navigation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want files to be stored efficiently in Cloudflare R2, so that the system can scale and perform well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is created THEN the system SHALL store it in Cloudflare R2 with a unique key
2. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention that includes user ID and timestamp
3. WHEN storing file metadata THEN the system SHALL record R2 key, file size, and creation timestamp in the database
4. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove both the R2 object and database record
5. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL stream directly from R2 to minimize memory usage
