# Cutty Agent V1 Requirements

## Introduction

Following successful validation of the Cloudflare Agent proof of concept, V1 implements core action execution capabilities. This version transforms Cutty from a Q&A chatbot into an agent that can perform real tasks while maintaining a manageable scope.

## Prerequisites

- Successful completion of Agent PoC
- Validated Agent deployment and stability
- Proven frontend-to-Agent communication
- Decision to proceed with Agent architecture

## V1 Goals

Transform the basic Agent into a functional assistant that can:
1. Execute actions on user behalf
2. Maintain conversation context
3. Handle confirmations for sensitive actions
4. Provide clear feedback on action results

## Core Requirements

### Requirement 1: Action Execution via Natural Language

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request actions in plain English and have Cutty execute them, so I don't need to navigate through the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I say "Generate 50 voters from California" THEN the agent SHALL execute synthetic data generation
2. WHEN I say "Show me my files" THEN the agent SHALL list my uploaded files
3. WHEN I say "What states are supported?" THEN the agent SHALL execute the getSupportedStates tool
4. WHEN the agent doesn't understand THEN it SHALL ask for clarification
5. WHEN actions complete THEN I SHALL see the results clearly formatted

### Requirement 2: Human-in-the-Loop Confirmations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to confirm actions before they execute, so I maintain control over what happens with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an action modifies data THEN a confirmation dialog SHALL appear
2. WHEN I confirm THEN the action SHALL execute and show results
3. WHEN I cancel THEN the action SHALL abort with acknowledgment
4. WHEN viewing confirmations THEN I SHALL see exactly what will happen
5. WHEN multiple actions are queued THEN each SHALL require separate confirmation

### Requirement 3: Context-Aware Conversations

**User Story:** As a user, I want Cutty to remember our conversation, so I can have natural follow-up interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I reference "the data I just generated" THEN the agent SHALL understand the context
2. WHEN I ask follow-up questions THEN the agent SHALL maintain topic continuity
3. WHEN context expires (30 min idle) THEN the agent SHALL politely indicate a fresh start
4. WHEN switching topics THEN the agent SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 4: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to respect my authentication and only access my data, so my information stays secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I'm logged in THEN the agent SHALL have access to my user context
2. WHEN I'm not authenticated THEN the agent SHALL limit available actions
3. WHEN accessing user-specific data THEN the agent SHALL validate permissions
4. WHEN authentication expires THEN the agent SHALL handle gracefully

## Tool Implementation

### Phase 1 Tools (Core Functionality)
1. **generateSyntheticData** - Create test voter data with parameters
2. **getSupportedStates** - List available states for data generation
3. **listUserFiles** - Show files uploaded by the authenticated user
4. **explainFeature** - Describe app features in detail

### Tool Design Principles
- Tools should complete within 10 seconds
- Each tool has clear input validation
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Results are formatted for chat display

## Technical Requirements

- Migrate from AI Worker to Agent for chat endpoint
- Implement streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Add confirmation UI components to chat interface
- Store conversation context in Durable Object state
- Pass JWT tokens to Agent for authentication

## Success Metrics

- 80% of synthetic data requests execute successfully
- 90% of users understand confirmation dialogs
- Average action completion under 5 seconds
- 95% positive feedback on agent helpfulness
- Zero security incidents from agent actions

## Implementation Timeline

### Month 1: Core Infrastructure
- Migrate chat endpoint to Agent
- Implement basic tool framework
- Add streaming response support
- Deploy to development

### Month 2: Tool Development
- Build and test all Phase 1 tools
- Add confirmation flow UI
- Implement context management
- Integrate authentication

### Month 3: Polish & Launch
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- User documentation
- Gradual production rollout

## Migration Strategy

1. **Feature Flag Control**: Toggle between AI Worker and Agent per user
2. **Canary Deployment**: Start with 5% of users, increase gradually
3. **Monitoring**: Track success rates and performance metrics
4. **Rollback Ready**: Maintain AI Worker as fallback for 30 days
5. **User Communication**: Clear changelog and feature announcements

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Durable Object cold starts affecting response time
- Streaming response compatibility across browsers
- Tool timeout handling for slow operations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement aggressive caching strategies
- Test on all major browsers
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Maintain comprehensive error logging

## Future Considerations (Not in V1)

- Multi-step workflows
- Scheduled task execution
- File upload capabilities
- Advanced analytics queries
- Third-party integrations

These features are intentionally excluded from V1 to maintain focus on core functionality and ensure a successful initial release.
