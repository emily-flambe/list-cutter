# Cutty Agent V2 Requirements

## Introduction

Building on V1's success with basic action execution and confirmation flows, V2 expands Cutty Agent into a comprehensive AI assistant capable of complex workflows, advanced tool integration, and intelligent multi-step reasoning. This version leverages the full power of Cloudflare's AI Agents SDK.

## Prerequisites

- Successful deployment and user adoption of Cutty Agent V1
- Proven stability of core agent functions (data generation, file listing)
- Validated user demand for advanced agent capabilities
- Positive user feedback on agent interaction model

## V2 Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Tool Suite

**User Story:** As a power user, I want the agent to access all Cutty app features, so I can control the entire application through conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user asks to manage files THEN the agent SHALL execute file operations (upload, delete, download)
2. WHEN a user requests CSV processing THEN the agent SHALL execute CSV cutting with specified options
3. WHEN a user asks about storage THEN the agent SHALL query and display detailed metrics
4. WHEN a user needs to import data THEN the agent SHALL handle person record imports
5. WHEN new app features are added THEN tools SHALL be easily addable to the agent

### Requirement 2: Multi-Step Workflow Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request complex tasks that require multiple steps, so I can accomplish sophisticated goals with a single request.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request "Generate data and upload it to a new list" THEN the agent SHALL execute both steps sequentially
2. WHEN steps depend on each other THEN the agent SHALL pass context between them
3. WHEN a step fails THEN the agent SHALL handle errors gracefully and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN executing workflows THEN the agent SHALL provide progress updates for each step
5. WHEN I request a workflow THEN the agent SHALL confirm the full plan before executing

### Requirement 3: Advanced Scheduling & Long-Running Tasks

**User Story:** As a user, I want to schedule tasks and run long operations, so I can automate repetitive work and handle large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request a delayed task THEN the agent SHALL schedule it for the specified time
2. WHEN I set up recurring tasks THEN the agent SHALL execute them on a cron schedule
3. WHEN tasks take minutes/hours THEN the agent SHALL run them asynchronously with status updates
4. WHEN scheduled tasks complete THEN I SHALL receive notifications
5. WHEN I query scheduled tasks THEN the agent SHALL show all pending/completed tasks

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Context & Reasoning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to understand complex requests and make intelligent decisions, so I can communicate naturally without specific commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN my request is ambiguous THEN the agent SHALL ask clarifying questions
2. WHEN multiple approaches exist THEN the agent SHALL recommend the best option
3. WHEN I reference previous work THEN the agent SHALL understand across sessions
4. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the agent SHALL learn my preferences
5. WHEN context is important THEN the agent SHALL consider file contents and metadata

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a team member, I want real-time updates and shared agent sessions, so multiple people can work together effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN using WebSockets THEN updates SHALL stream in real-time
2. WHEN multiple users access shared data THEN changes SHALL sync immediately
3. WHEN collaborating THEN users SHALL see who's doing what
4. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the agent SHALL handle them intelligently
5. WHEN sessions are shared THEN permissions SHALL be enforced

### Requirement 6: Advanced Security & Permissions

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want granular control over agent permissions, so I can ensure data security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users have different roles THEN agent capabilities SHALL adjust accordingly
2. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN multi-factor confirmation SHALL be required
3. WHEN accessing restricted data THEN the agent SHALL check permissions per item
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN all actions SHALL be logged with full context
5. WHEN rate limits apply THEN they SHALL be configurable per user/role

### Requirement 7: Analytics & Insights

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to provide insights about my data and usage, so I can make better decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I ask about trends THEN the agent SHALL analyze my data patterns
2. WHEN inefficiencies exist THEN the agent SHALL suggest optimizations
3. WHEN I need reports THEN the agent SHALL generate them with visualizations
4. WHEN comparing datasets THEN the agent SHALL highlight differences
5. WHEN predictions help THEN the agent SHALL offer data-driven forecasts

### Requirement 8: Extensibility & Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the agent with custom tools and external integrations, so it can adapt to specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN adding custom tools THEN a plugin system SHALL support them
2. WHEN integrating external APIs THEN the agent SHALL handle authentication
3. WHEN webhooks are needed THEN the agent SHALL send/receive them
4. WHEN custom workflows are defined THEN the agent SHALL execute them
5. WHEN extending functionality THEN documentation SHALL guide developers
