# Phase 6: Authentication & Security Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress for Phase 6 of the Cloudflare Workers migration, focusing on authentication and security features.

## Implementation Status

- [x] Research phase completed
- [x] Codebase analysis completed  
- [x] Library research completed
- [x] Worktree created
- [ ] Draft PR created
- [ ] Security middleware implementation
- [ ] Enhanced JWT service
- [ ] Password security improvements
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Security headers
- [ ] KV session management
- [ ] Testing implementation
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Key Features Being Implemented

### Authentication System
- Enhanced JWT implementation with proper token lifecycle
- PBKDF2 password hashing for Django compatibility
- Refresh token management with Workers KV
- User registration, login, and profile endpoints

### Security Features
- Rate limiting using Cloudflare Workers native capabilities
- Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)
- CORS configuration for unified architecture
- Authentication middleware with JWT validation

### Infrastructure
- Workers KV for session and token storage
- Enhanced D1 database schema
- Security-focused wrangler.toml configuration
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Architecture Benefits

The unified Workers deployment provides:
- Single security perimeter for all resources
- Simplified authentication flow without CORS complexity
- Edge-native security with global distribution
- Centralized rate limiting and monitoring
- Cost-effective security implementation

## Next Steps

1. Complete draft PR creation
2. Implement enhanced security middleware
3. Upgrade JWT service with full token lifecycle
4. Add comprehensive rate limiting
5. Implement security headers and CSP
6. Add extensive testing coverage
7. Update documentation and deployment guides
