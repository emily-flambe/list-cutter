# MIDDLEWARE ERROR FIX PLAN

## Root Cause
The "c.next is not a function" error occurs because:
1. **Deployment State Mismatch**: Old workers still deployed with previous naming scheme
2. **Route Conflicts**: Preview URL hitting wrong worker instance
3. **Cached Middleware**: Old middleware structure in production

## IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. Clean Up Old Worker Deployments
```bash
cd cloudflare/workers

# List all current workers and deployments
wrangler deployments list

# If old workers exist, delete them:
wrangler delete list-cutter-workers-dev 2>/dev/null || true
wrangler delete list-cutter-workers-staging 2>/dev/null || true  
wrangler delete list-cutter-workers-prod 2>/dev/null || true
wrangler delete cutty-api 2>/dev/null || true

# Check what workers currently exist
wrangler list
```

### 2. Force Fresh Deployment
```bash
# Clear any cached deployments
rm -rf .wrangler/
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/

# Deploy fresh version
wrangler deploy --force

# Verify the deployment
wrangler deployments list
```

### 3. Test the Fix
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://e81ff278-cutty.emily-cogsdill.workers.dev/health

# If still getting errors, try:
wrangler dev --remote=false  # Test locally first
wrangler deploy --env development  # Deploy to dev environment
```

### 4. Update Route Patterns (if needed)
Check if your custom domain routes are pointing to the correct worker:
```bash
# Check current route configuration
wrangler routes list

# If routes point to old worker, update them in wrangler.toml
```

## FILES ALREADY FIXED
✅ `validate-deployment.sh` - Updated worker names  
✅ `src/index.ts` - Fixed middleware patterns

## VERIFICATION STEPS
After deployment:
1. Test preview URL: https://e81ff278-cutty.emily-cogsdill.workers.dev/
2. Check middleware chain with: `/health` endpoint
3. Verify no "c.next is not a function" errors
4. Test file upload/download endpoints

## IF PROBLEM PERSISTS
If error continues after cleanup:
1. Check Cloudflare dashboard for multiple workers
2. Verify environment variables are set on correct worker
3. Check that database/R2 bindings match worker name
4. Consider creating entirely new worker with fresh name

## EMERGENCY ROLLBACK
If needed, you can temporarily use the old configuration:
```bash
cp wrangler-phase6.toml wrangler.toml  # Use old config
wrangler deploy
```

## SUCCESS INDICATORS
- ✅ Preview URL loads without errors
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 status
- ✅ Middleware chain functions correctly
- ✅ No "c.next is not a function" in logs
