## PRD 5: Advanced Identity Resolution & Schema Management

### Overview
Build a comprehensive identity resolution system for organizations that need sophisticated deduplication, record matching, and flexible schema management across multiple data sources.

### Prerequisites
- Completed: Simple Data Consolidation (Spec 1)
- Completed: Dynamic Segmentation (Spec 2)
- Completed: Duplicate Removal (Spec 3)
- Completed: API Interoperability (Spec 4)

### Goals
- 95%+ accuracy in identifying duplicate records across sources
- Support complex matching rules and ML-based improvements
- Handle any schema from any platform
- Enable true Master Data Management (MDM) capabilities

### User Stories

**Data Administrator**
- As a data admin, I want to define custom matching rules based on my organization's data
- As a data admin, I want to review and train the matching algorithm
- As a data admin, I want to handle household relationships and family connections
- As a data admin, I want to merge records across different systems with different schemas

**Data Analyst**
- As an analyst, I want to see confidence scores for all matches
- As an analyst, I want to understand why records were matched
- As an analyst, I want to manually override matching decisions
- As an analyst, I want to track identity resolution performance over time

### Functional Requirements

**Advanced Matching Engine**

*Machine Learning Based Matching*
- Train on organization's confirmed matches/non-matches
- Multiple similarity algorithms:
  - Jaro-Winkler distance for names
  - Levenshtein distance for typos
  - Soundex/Metaphone for phonetic matching
  - Nickname databases (Bob → Robert)
- Feature engineering:
  - Name similarity score
  - Email domain matching
  - Phone area code matching
  - Address proximity (via geocoding)
  - Temporal patterns (records created near same time)

*Confidence Scoring*
- Probabilistic scoring (0-100%)
- Explainable AI - show which factors contributed
- Configurable thresholds by match type
- A/B testing framework for algorithm improvements

*Rule Engine*
- Visual rule builder with AND/OR logic
- Custom JavaScript functions for complex rules
- Rule templates for common scenarios:
  - Same person, different email
  - Married name changes
  - Business vs personal email
  - Parent/child relationships

**Schema Intelligence**

*Auto-Schema Learning*
- Detect patterns across imports
- Suggest field mappings based on data content
- Learn from user corrections
- Version control for schema evolution

*Advanced Transformations*
- Complex field calculations
- Cross-field validations
- External data enrichment (USPS, phone validation)
- Custom transformation functions

*Multi-Source Reconciliation*
- Define source priority hierarchies
- Field-level merge strategies
- Conflict resolution workflows
- Data lineage tracking

**Identity Graph**

*Relationship Mapping*
- Individual → Household
- Employee → Organization  
- Student → School
- Volunteer → Campaign
- Graph visualization of connections

*Temporal Identity*
- Track identity changes over time
- Historical record preservation
- Point-in-time identity queries

**Quality Management**

*Automated Quality Checks*
- Email deliverability verification
- Phone carrier validation
- Address standardization (CASS certified)
- Deceased suppression
- Do-not-contact compliance

*Data Stewardship*
- Assignment of data quality tasks
- Review queues by confidence level
- Bulk operation tools
- Quality trend dashboards

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Handle 10M+ records
- Real-time matching for API calls
- Batch processing for large imports
- Distributed processing for scale

**Machine Learning**
- Online learning from user feedback
- Model versioning and rollback
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Explainable predictions

**Integration**
- REST API for all operations
- Webhook notifications
- Event streaming for real-time sync
- Standard MDM interfaces

### Success Metrics
- 95%+ precision in matching
- 90%+ recall for duplicates
- 50% reduction in manual review time
- 10x improvement in data quality scores

### Technical Considerations
- Use of vector databases for similarity search
- GPU acceleration for ML models
- Distributed graph database for relationships
- Stream processing for real-time updates

### Estimated Effort
- 6-9 months with dedicated team
- Requires ML engineer, data engineer, full-stack developers
- Ongoing model training and optimization

### Dependencies
- External services: Address validation, phone validation
- ML infrastructure: Model training, serving, monitoring
- Graph database for relationship management
- Vector database for similarity matching
